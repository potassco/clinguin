AngularFrontend
---------------

This frontend was developed using `Angular <https://angular.io/guide/setup-local>`_.
For styling, it uses the `bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_ library with `Angular-Boostrap <https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home>`_.
Thus, providing beautiful components out of the box by giving access to Bootstrap classes for styling.
For contributing with new components take a look at the :ref:`Development` section.

.. admonition:: Examples
