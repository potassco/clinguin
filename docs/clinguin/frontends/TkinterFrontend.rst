TkinterFrontend
---------------

This frontend uses the standard Python interface `tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html>`_ to generate a UI.

.. admonition:: Examples


    * `Tkinter Examples <https://github.com/krr-up/clinguin/tree/master/examples/tkinter>`_

One can look up the available elements, with the corresponding attributes and callback actions using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clinguin client-server --frontend-syntax

If one is also interested in what values one might set, one can also look at the full syntax:

.. code-block:: console

    $ clinguin client-server --frontend-syntax-full

.. tip::

    We suggest using the :ref:`AngularFrontend` instead. It is more powerful and has a modern look.
